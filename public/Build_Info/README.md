### What I learned
had the opportunity to build a tip calculator using React and Tailwind CSS, and it was an incredibly educational experience. Throughout the project, I learned a lot about conditional rendering in React, responsive design, and props drilling.

One of the biggest takeaways from this project was the importance of conditional rendering in React. In a tip calculator, there are several different components that need to be displayed or hidden based on user input. For example, if the user selects a custom tip percentage, the app needs to display an input field where they can enter that percentage. If they select a pre-defined tip amount, that input field should be hidden. Using conditional rendering allowed me to easily manage these different states and ensure that the app was displaying the correct information at all times.

Another key skill I developed while building the tip calculator was responsive design. With so many different screen sizes and devices available today, it's more important than ever to ensure that your apps look good and function properly on all of them. I used Tailwind CSS to create a responsive layout for the app, adjusting font sizes, margins, and padding as needed to ensure that it looked great on everything from a smartphone to a desktop computer.

Finally, I learned a lot about props drilling. In React, props are used to pass data between different components in your app. In the tip calculator, I had several nested components that needed to communicate with each other, and passing data down through multiple layers of components can be tricky. By carefully planning the structure of my components and passing props down only as needed, I was able to avoid any major issues with props drilling.

Overall, building a tip calculator using React and Tailwind CSS was an incredibly valuable learning experience. I gained a deeper understanding of conditional rendering, responsive design, and props drilling, and I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects.
